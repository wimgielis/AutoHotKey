# AutoHotKey
A set of tools written in the automation language AutoHotKey

Download the exe file and store it anywhere you like.

A set of tools can be started by pressing the F10 function key. A menu will appear.
Most tools are to be used in Notepad++ or Turbo Integrator.

The corresponding AHK file contains the source code. Please keep my header in it.

I also put out my custom TM1 language menu in Notepad++. The code in the exe file will be toggle it on automatically.
